Compare the answer to what you have in mind, then drag the range slider to tell the system how well you remembered the answer.

    The response ranges from 0 to 5. 
    0 is not remembering the term and 5 is 100% remembering the term. 
    In this example, I dragged the slider to 4, so it displays "correct response after a hesitation - 4".
    After you have selected your response, click "Submit" to go to the next question.

Click on submit to go to the next question. You can see your progress from the progress bar.
