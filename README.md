You can see the answer: ウェイター - waiter
Compare the answer to what you have in mind, then drag the range slider to tell the system how well you remembered the answer.

The response ranges from 0 to 5. 0 is not remembering the term and 5 is 100% remembering the term. In this example, I dragged the slider all the way to the right, so it displays “perfect response - 5”.
After you have selected your response, click “Submit” to go to the next question.
